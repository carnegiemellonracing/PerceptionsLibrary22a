""" interface.py

This file contains the interface definining a [Predictor] object for 
perceptions. 

CMR Perception's primary goal is taking sensor data and estimating the
3D positions of cones with ...
    - high accuracy = estimated positions of cones are close to true positions
    - high recall = more cones are have estimated positions than fewer ones
    - low latency = functions return quickly and are efficient

Subclasses of the [Predictor] interface will implement various computer-vision
based algorithms to take sensor data and estimate 3D cone position.

Usage of Predictor classes will be as follows

>>> dl = DataLoader(<path>)
>>> predictor = Predictor()
>>> for i in range(len(dl)):
>>>     data = dl[i]
>>>     cones = predictor.predict(data) 
>>>     predictor.display()

            - np.float32 datatype
                - see Wikipedia article on "Single-precision floating-format"
            - Columns: [x, y, z, intensity, ring, timestamp]
                - x, y, and z are in meters
                - intesity is a value from 0-255 representing point reflectivity
                - ring is the index of laser that point was created from
                - timestamp is the time at which laser was shot or received
        - left stereocamera images
            - (H, W, 4) where H and W are the height and width of the image
            - np.uint8 datatype
            - 4 channels are [R, G, B, Alpha]
        - depth stereocamera images

            - np.float32 datatype
            - elements are either nan or the depth of the object at pixel
                - see Wikipedia article on "NaN" for what a nan variable is
        - xyz stereocamea images

            - np.float32 datatype
